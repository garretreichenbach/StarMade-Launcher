    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <ul class="faq">
        <faq-entry question="The game does not start after clicking on 'Launch' in the launcher. What should I do?">Browse to your StarMade game (usually StarMade/StarMade) directory, and look in the
            folder named /logs. Open the file named log.txt.0 with a text editor, and scroll to the bottom. This should help you troubleshoot the issue.We can also help via support, if needed. Create
            a ticket
            <external-link href="http://help.star-made.org/helpdesk/tickets/new">here</external-link>
            , and be sure to attach the log.txt.0 file, as the info it contains is invaluable in helping locate the cause.
        </faq-entry>
        <faq-entry note="(Windows Only)" question="The intro movie is painfully slow, and the sound stutters after launching the game. Help!">The overwhelming cause of this is having the 32bit version
            of the launcher installed on a 64bit system. Please verify that you have the correct version installed! If you're still having the issue (or if the game is installed via Steam, as it
            handles the selection for you), it could be due to something else. Please make a support ticket, and we will do our best to help.

        <faq-entry note="(OSX Only)" question="The game states: &quot;You need the Java Runtime Environment to view this content&quot;, although it is installed.">For OSX (especially yosemite), you
            need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) to have the system register the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

        <faq-entry question="I'm encountering terrible graphics performance, and computer should perform better. What gives?">There are various reasons for lower game performance. The most common
            reasons are:
            <ol>
                <li>Outdated video drivers. Please look for updated drivers on your video card manufacturer's<br/>(and your computer manufacturer's) websites.</li>
                <li>Multi-GPU systems, like notebooks, tend to run java with the powersaving GPU.<br/>Right click the launcher executable and use the option: "Execute with: -> High performance GPU"
                </li>
                <li>Try increasing the amount of RAM available to the game.<br/>You can find the memory settings button to the left of the <span style="color: cyan">[LAUNCH] </span>button below.</li>
                <li>Try decreasing the "Max View Segments" option within the game's settings.<br/>This has a small effect on the game's graphics, but can have a large impact on framerate.</li>
            </ol>
        </faq-entry>
        <faq-entry question="How do I fix stuttering sound, or having no sound at all?">Turn off the option "Use OpenAL" in the connection dialog.</faq-entry>
        <faq-entry question="I get the error &quot;No Login name given&quot; on trying to uplink.">You need to fill in the field for the in-game-name before opening the uplink dialog.</faq-entry>
        <faq-entry question="Can I change my password?">Of course! Log in to the registry at
            <external-link href="https://registry.star-made.org">registry.star-made.org</external-link>
            , and click on your name in the top right corner. Use the "Edit profile" option and finally click on "update password".
        </faq-entry>
        <faq-entry question="Where can I look up if my account is limited (free-to-play) or upgraded (purchased)?">Log in to the registry at
            <external-link href="https://registry.star-made.org">registry.star-made.org</external-link>
            , click on "Main menu" then on "Profile" (under "My Account"). The status shown in the field named "Account Status:" is either Upgraded or Limited, with "Upgraded" confirming you have
            purchased the game.
